## üìÖ Data Structure

The data is organized hierarchically, with each county having multiple constituencies, and each constituency containing multiple wards. Here is an example of the structure of the data:

```
{
  "county": "Nairobi",
  "constituencies": [
    {
      "name": "Westlands",
      "wards": [
        {
          "name": "Kitisuru"
        },
        {
          "name": "Parklands/Highridge"
        },
        {
          "name": "Karura"
        },
        {
          "name": "Kangemi"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Dagoretti South",
      "wards": [
        {
          "name": "Mutu-ini"
        },
        {
          "name": "Ngando"
        },
        {
          "name": "Karen"
        },
        {
          "name": "Mugumo-ini"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

The `county` field contains the name of the county, while the `constituencies` field is an array of objects, with each object representing a constituency. Each constituency object contains the name field as well as an array of `wards`, with each ward object containing the name field.
